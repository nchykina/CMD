            <p>2.1.1. We enable you to use the Website for running Pipelines on our servers 
                with the aim to process your input data into a format that is suitable for 
                further analysis and visualization.</p>
            <p>2.1.2. You are provided free access to DNA resequencing Pipeline upon registration
                of a user account at www.ngspipeline.com. All other Pipelines are available upon subscription.</p>
            <p>2.1.3. You have no limit on the number of times you can launch any pipeline, and you
                can launch as many pipelines simultaneously as you want. Please note, however,
                that you have to manage your file storage size carefully, as every pipeline 
                generates output data that consumes your storage space.</p>
            <p>2.1.4. We kindly ask you to read carefully and follow the instructions for input 
                datasets when launching your pipelines against your custom data. These instructions 
                are published on our Website on corresponding webpages. Although we perform extensive
                validation on our side, following these instructions will definitely save you time and effort.</p>

            <p>2.1.1. NGS Pipeline Inc. enables you to use the Website for placing files in the 
                disk space of NGS Pipeline servers with the aim to store files in such space,
                to use them to launch the Pipelines, to download or delete these files, as
                well as in any other manner not contradicting the provisions of the Terms 
                of Service and the applicable law.</p>
            <p>2.1.2. You are provided 20 GB of storage space for no compensation upon registration
                of a user account at www.ngspipeline.com. The storage space may be extended by 
                any amount proportional to 100 GB provided that you pay a fee to NGS Pipeline Inc.</p>
            <p>2.1.3. Storage space limit provided to you is used for both the files uploaded by you 
                (hereinafter, the <b>“Input Files”</b>) and the files generated as an output of the
                Pipelines you launched (hereinafter, the <b>“Output Files”</b>). It is your responsibility
                to manage the free space of your file storage by deleting the unused files as it is 
                deemed necessary.</p>
            <p>2.1.4. If you have subscribed for extended storage space service and have used more than
                20 GB storage space but then decided not to pay the fee for the next period, you
                will be disallowed to upload new files to your file storage from the beginning 
                of such period until you renew your subscription or until the volume of placed data
                is reduced to the size allowed for the free use of service.</p>

            <p>2.2.1. NGS Pipeline Inc. provides you with a shared access to its processing capacity
                to launch your Pipelines free of charge. The processing speed is highly dependent
                on the activity of other customers at a point in time.</p>
            <p>2.2.2. If you purchase “Extra vCPUs” Additional Feature, you will have a dedicated 
                set of vCPUs, which will most likely speed up your data processing. Please note, 
                however, that the algorithms used in our Pipelines can be very complex and their 
                performance is determined by many different factors. We do not guarantee that 
                your pipeline runtime will scale linearly with the number of vCPUs.</p>
