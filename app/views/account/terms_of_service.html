             <h3>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</h3>

             <p>2.1. Under this Agreement, NGS Pipeline provides its customers with the 
                 following online services:</p>

                    <li>access to the bioinformatics data processing algorithms, or 
                        “pipelines”, (hereinafter, the <b>“Pipelines”</b>) that we offer through it;</li>
                <li>access to additional on-demand features and options that can improve user 
                    experience for a particular client, such as additional file storage 
                    space on our servers or ability to increase the speed of data processing 
                    (hereinafter, the <b>“Additional Features”</b>).</li>
             </ul>

             <p>2.2. Each of the Pipelines is a bundled combination of proprietary software

                 third-party open-source software products launched in particular order
                 and manner, with specific parameters optimized for cluster environment.</p> 

             <p>2.3. For experienced users, we offer an advanced option to add their own 
                 fully customized Pipelines to our system. Addition of each of such Pipelines
                 is considered as a separate consulting project that is priced and negotiated
                 with the customer on a case-by-case basis and is subject to a separate contract agreement.</p>

                proprietary and custom content (the <b>“Private Materials”</b>). Both Private and 
                Public Materials are provided with the main purpose to guide you through the 
                functionality of our website (as they consist of sample genomic and annotation
                data, guides, articles, images, notes, user experience tours etc.)</p>

            <h3>3. PREREQUISITES</h3>

             <p>3.1. You confirm and acknowledge that you are of sufficient age to access this

             <h3>4. ACCEPTABLE USE </h3>

             <h4>4.1. User account registration and maintenance </h4>

             <p>4.1.1. Access to certain areas of this Website is restricted and requires user
                 registration. Upon your registration on our Website, you will have a User ID 
                 and password, permitting you to access the Services and Materials. </p>

             <p>4.1.2. It is your responsibility to keep your user credentials confidential. 
                 You agree and are obliged not to share your User ID with anyone else. We 
                 can occasionally monitor your user authentication activity and may prohibit 
                 simultaneous user sessions with the same user account data from multiple 
                 locations/devices. We may suspend your access to our Services and Materials
                 in case of regular infringement of this policy without any prior notice or explanation. </p>

              <p>4.1.3. You also agree to fully and accurately provide the information requested 
                  by us when setting up your account and to regularly update such information. 
                  Your failure to do so may result in the suspension or cancellation of your 
                  account and loss of access to the Services and Materials. In particular, 
                  we highly recommend you to keep the email data in your user account at our
                  Website up-to-date, as you will need this data to restore your password in
                  case you forget it. </p>

              <h4>4.2. User Content upload and storage</h4>

              <p>4.2.1. In these TOS, by user content (hereinafter, the <b>“Content”</b> or the
                  <b>“User Content”</b>) we mean the data files that you submit to our Website 
                  to be subsequently processed at your discretion in any of our Pipelines 
                  and/or stored in your private file storage on our servers. Acceptable 
                  usage of NGS Pipeline’s Services assumes that your User Content is not 
                  illegal or unlawful in any way, does not infringe any third party’s legal
                  rights and is not capable of giving rise to legal action against you, 
                  NGS Pipeline or any third party. </p>

                <p>4.2.2. NGS Pipeline reserves the right to remove any User Content submitted 
                    to our Website, or stored on our servers. Furthermore, you must acknowledge 
                    that we also may access and monitor the submitted User Content from time to 
                    time at our discretion, with the sole purpose of providing better data 
                    services to our customers. We do not monitor all User Content submitted 
                    to our Website by our customers and don’t assume any responsibility for
                    compliance of this Content with any applicable law.</p>

                <p>4.2.3. Please also note that the intended use of our Services and Materials 
                    assumes frequent uploading and downloading large files (more than 1-2 Gb)
                    to and from our website. In order to use our Services and Materials in 
                    an efficient manner, it is your responsibility to obtain high-quality 
                    Internet access and all equipment necessary to make such Internet connection. </p>

                <h4>4.3. Subscription to Services</h4>

                <p>4.3.1. You must acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services
                    provided by NGS Pipeline may change from time to time without any prior 
                    notice to you. You acknowledge and agree that we may stop providing some
                    Services (or any features within the Services) to our clients at our sole 
                    discretion. You may stop using the Services of NGS Pipeline at any time. </p>

                <p>4.3.2. Access to paid Pipelines and Additional Features is further regulated 
                    by General Terms and Conditions and Price Schedule and Supplemental Terms 
                    that together form a <b>Subscription Agreement</b>.</p>


                <h4>4.4. Custom Pipelines</h4>

                <p>4.4.1. You have an option to order a custom project from us to implement 
                    your data processing pipelines within the interface of our Website. 
                    In order to do it, you have to send a request for proposal through a 
                    form on our Website or to <a href="mailto:support@ngspipeline.com">support@ngspipeline.com</a>
                    that will specify the details about your pipeline and the algorithms 
                    it uses (description of the input and output data, software used and
                    its parameters, performance requirements etc.) </p>

                <p>4.4.2. After we analyze this information (it usually takes 1-3 business days),
                    we will get back to you with a preliminary offer that will contain an estimate 
                    of implementation time and cost. Afterwards, if you are interested in this 
                    offer, our further collaboration will be negotiated in the form of a 
                    separate and binding contract that will describe all your technical 
                    requirements in more detail. From our experience, such projects take 
                    1-2 weeks on average.</p>

                <p>4.4.3. You must acknowledge and agree that, although we do it extremely 
                    rarely in practice, we reserve the right to withdraw our consent to 
                    implement a custom pipeline project for you in case of special circumstances. 
                    The factors that may influence our decision to do it are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>Your current pipelines use a lot of your own custom and proprietary 
                        scripting and/or third-party software that is error-prone and poorly 
                        documented (if at all) instead of relying on commonly used and 
                        popular packages and libraries;</li>
                    <li>The datasets that you are analyzing are extremely large or corrupted, 
                        and their processing can’t be parallelized in an efficient manner 
                        within a reasonable time and amount of effort.</li>
                    <li>The software packages that you are using are incompatible with our 
                        back-end architecture and can’t be easily substituted to other 
                        software packages with similar functionality.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. CUSTOMER CONDUCT: UNLAWFUL AND PROHIBITED USE</h3>
